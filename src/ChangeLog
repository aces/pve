2014-09-01  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * more extensions for processing at arbitrary voxel size (0.5mm, 1.0mm)
        * changes to MCD and MVE calculation of the variance for CSF class to
          avoid background values (not done for pve3)

2014-03-04  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * fix bugs in geo_smooth.cc: put () around division by voxel
          size and division by zero magnitude of gradient; enforce
          stability condition on dt
        * clean-up pve_curvature for arbitrary voxel size
        * conveniently call pve_curvature from within pve_script
        * enforce symmetric convergence as the default
        * use unsigned short for likelihood volumes to prevent memory
          crash when the t1 image is in float or double.

2013-07-08  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * major speed optimizations in pve and pve3
	* make convergence symmetric (forward/backward sweeps)
	* resample mask like input in pve_script.in

2011-07-13  Claude Lepage      <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * pve_script, pve, pve3: default is now -mlonly to produce
          exact maximum likelihood estimates
        * clean-up memory frees to reduce peak memory on pve files

2010-02-09  Claude Lepage   <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * Use -byte in discretize_pve
        * Fix bug with downsampling for MVE and MCD (was never done before)
        * Test for background class in discretize_pve to prevent rounding errors
          when background is a very small positive value (would make bg to be wm)

2009-10-02  Claude Lepage   <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
        * Add -classify option to save final classification of pure
          classes based on probabilistic maps, not maximum likelihoods
        * Optimize some memory usage when saving likelihoods

2009-07-07      Claude Lepage   <claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Check for memory allocation on minc volume (done for pve, not yet for pve3)

2007-09-19	Claude Lepage	<claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Speed optimizations: use Gauss-Legendre quadrature of order 4 to
          integrate marginalized likelihoods
	* Fixed a bug with dimensions of vector width_stencil (causing seg fault)
	* Make version at 1.1.6 for quarantine.

2006-12-15	Claude Lepage	<claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Fixed bug in pve3 for WMGM variance
	* Allow sub-cortical gray class for all options in pve and pve3
	* Remove class CSFBG since there should not be any trace of BG
          (or any of its derived classes) inside the masked region (assuming
          the mask is good, of course)
	* Add option to correct the mean and variance of tissue classes 
          during the iterations (helpful when initial classification from
          classify_clean is lousy)
	* Apply non-linear transformation to model (icbm152) on mask for
          sub-cortical tissue (in pve_script)
	* Make version at 1.1.5 for quarantine.

2006-11-10	Claude Lepage	<claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Optimized Compute_mrf_probability by taking sqrt outside loop
        (makes function 7 times faster!)
	* Make version at 1.1.4 for quarantine.

2006-08-11	Claude Lepage	<claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Add end point range checking for voxel values out of range;
        Distinguish between real CSF and real BG in t2 and pd.
	* Make version at 1.1.3 for quarantine.

2006-04-28	Claude Lepage	<claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* add epm-header; remove absolute path to gipt.mnc in pve_script;
        change .pl to .in with xPERLx to @PERL@; clean-up MNI::DataDir.

2006-04-04	Claude Lepage	<claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* Remove Spawn from pve_curvature.pl avec replace it with simple system
        calls since Spawn was occasionnally crashing with no space left on device,
        likely caused by Spawn running out of file buffers.
	* Make version at 1.1.2 for quarantine.

2006-03-20	Claude Lepage	<claude@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
	* added scripts/pve_4classes.pl for CIVET and make version
        at 1.1.1 for quarantine.

2005-02-04	Vivek Singh	<vsingh@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* updated the latex documentation to correspond 
	with the changes in argument parsing, curvature
	estimation, and the use of subcortical information

2004-12-20      Vivek Singh	<vsingh@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* modified the pve_curvature script to give 1:0.5
	weighting to the curvature and medial surface 
	information, respectively.  

2004-08-20      Vivek Singh     <vsingh@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* added a '-subcortical' option to the pve which makes
	use of subcortical tissue class in areas specified
	by a subcortical mask (located  in the models directory)
	* added a pve_script which runs either pve or pve3
	depending on the # of input files.  The main reason
	for it is to prevent users from having to specify
	the full path to the subcortical mask.

2004-08-03	Vivek Singh	<vsingh@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* intelligent argument parsing using ParseArgv introduced	
	* an option '-curve' to include a curvature/medial surface 
	image to modulate the MRF used in deep sulci CSF regions
	* a script to generate the curvature image in the scripts
	directory called pve_curvaure.pl

2004-07-29	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* ensured header inclusion in make dist
	
2004-02-03	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* added model specification options to pve_insect
	
2004-01-26	Jason Lerch	<jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

	* added scripts directory with discretize_pve.pl and pve_insect.pl
	in it.
	* bumped up version number to 1.0
	* updated NEWS
