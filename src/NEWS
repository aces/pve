New in release 1.4.2:
	* more extensions for processing at arbitrary voxel size (0.5mm, 1.0mm)
	* changes to MCD and MVE calculation of the variance for CSF class to
          avoid background values (not done for pve3)
        * freeze random number seed generator for sampling points

New in release 1.4.1:
        * fix bugs in geo_smooth.cc: put () around division by voxel
          size and division by zero magnitude of gradient; enforce
          stability condition on dt
        * clean-up pve_curvature for arbitrary voxel size
        * conveniently call pve_curvature from within pve_script
        * enforce symmetric convergence as the default
        * use unsigned short for likelihood volumes to prevent memory
          crash when the t1 image is in float or double.

n release 1.4.0:
        * major speed optimizations in pve and pve3
        * make convergence symmetric (forward/backward sweeps)
	* resample mask like input in pve_script.in

New in release 1.3.0:
        * pve_script, pve, pve3: default is now -mlonly to produce
          exact maximum likelihood estimates

New in release 1.2.1:
        * Use -byte in discretize_pve
        * Fix bug with downsampling for MVE and MCD (was never done before)
        * Test for background class in discretize_pve to prevent rounding errors
          when background is a very small positive value (would make bg to be wm)
        * Add -classify option to save final classification of pure
          classes based on probabilistic maps, not maximum likelihoods
        * Optimize some memory usage when saving likelihoods

New in release 1.2.0:
        * New license Copyright Alan C. Evans
        * Check for memory allocation on minc volume (done for pve, not yet for pve3)

New in release 1.1.6:
        * Speed optimizations: use Gauss-Legendre quadrature of order 4 to
          integrate marginalized likelihoods (makes pve zippy faster!)
        * Fixed a bug with dimensions of vector width_stencil (causing seg fault)

New in release 1.1.5:
        * Fixed bug in pve3 for WMGM variance
        * Allow sub-cortical gray class for all options in pve and pve3
        * Remove class CSFBG since there should not be any trace of BG
          (or any of its derived classes) inside the masked region (assuming
          the mask is good, of course)
        * Add option to correct the mean and variance of tissue classes
          during the iterations (helpful when initial classification from
          classify_clean is lousy)
        * Apply non-linear transformation to model (icbm152) on mask for
          sub-cortical tissue (in pve_script)

New in release 1.1.4:
        * Optimized Compute_mrf_probability by taking sqrt outside loop
        (makes pve zippy fast!)

New in release 1.1.3:
 	* Add end point range checking for voxel values out of range.
	* Distinguish between real CSF and real BG in t2 and pd.

New in release 1.1.2:
        * Remove Spawn from pve_curvature.pl avec replace it with simple system
        calls since Spawn was occasionnally crashing with no space left on device,
        likely caused by Spawn running out of file buffers.
	* clean-up for @PERL@ and removal of absolute paths

New in release 1.1.1:
        * New Perl scripts pve_4classes.pl to merge sub-cortical gray
        into white matter.

New in release 1.0:
        * Perl scripts to handle the entire pipeline up to 
	classification (pve_insect) as well as a script to rediscretize 
	partial volume maps.

New in release 0.90:
	* Autoconfiscation
	* Builds with GCC 3.2 & MIPSpro CC 7.30
