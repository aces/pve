New in release 1.1.7: (still pending)
	* Use -byte in discretize_pve

New in release 1.1.6:
        * Speed optimizations: use Gauss-Legendre quadrature of order 4 to
          integrate marginalized likelihoods (makes pve zippy faster!)
        * Fixed a bug with dimensions of vector width_stencil (causing seg fault)

New in release 1.1.5:
        * Fixed bug in pve3 for WMGM variance
        * Allow sub-cortical gray class for all options in pve and pve3
        * Remove class CSFBG since there should not be any trace of BG
          (or any of its derived classes) inside the masked region (assuming
          the mask is good, of course)
        * Add option to correct the mean and variance of tissue classes
          during the iterations (helpful when initial classification from
          classify_clean is lousy)
        * Apply non-linear transformation to model (icbm152) on mask for
          sub-cortical tissue (in pve_script)

New in release 1.1.4:
        * Optimized Compute_mrf_probability by taking sqrt outside loop
        (makes pve zippy fast!)

New in release 1.1.3:
 	* Add end point range checking for voxel values out of range.
	* Distinguish between real CSF and real BG in t2 and pd.

New in release 1.1.2:
        * Remove Spawn from pve_curvature.pl avec replace it with simple system
        calls since Spawn was occasionnally crashing with no space left on device,
        likely caused by Spawn running out of file buffers.
	* clean-up for @PERL@ and removal of absolute paths

New in release 1.1.1:
        * New Perl scripts pve_4classes.pl to merge sub-cortical gray
        into white matter.

New in release 1.0:
        * Perl scripts to handle the entire pipeline up to 
	classification (pve_insect) as well as a script to rediscretize 
	partial volume maps.

New in release 0.90:
	* Autoconfiscation
	* Builds with GCC 3.2 & MIPSpro CC 7.30
